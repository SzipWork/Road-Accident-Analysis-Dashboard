# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of road accident data using **Power BI**.  
The objective is to identify key patterns, trends, and factors contributing to road accidents in order to support data-driven decision-making aimed at improving road safety.  
The analysis is presented through interactive dashboards and detailed visualizations.

## Objectives
- To identify the major causes and contributing factors of road accidents.
- To analyze the distribution of accidents across different time periods (year, month, day, time of day).
- To assess accident trends based on geographical locations, weather conditions, and vehicle types.
- To examine accident severity and casualty statistics.
- To provide actionable insights for policymaking and road safety improvements.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Enabling dynamic exploration of accident data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Highlighting patterns over different timeframes.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Visualizing accident distribution across locations.
- **Severity Analysis**: Breaking down accidents based on severity levels (minor, major, fatal).
- **Factor Analysis**: Studying the impact of external factors such as weather and vehicle type.
- **Casualty Statistics**: Presenting data on injuries and fatalities.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query Editor**: For data cleaning and transformation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated measures and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Dataset
`Road Accident Data.xlsx`

## How to Use
1. Open the provided `.pbix` file using **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Navigate through the different dashboards using the tabs available.
3. Apply filters (e.g., year, vehicle type, weather condition) to perform segmented analysis.
4. Hover over visual elements to view detailed information and tooltips.

## Key Insights

- A significant number of accidents occur during adverse weather conditions.
- Two-wheeler and passenger vehicles are major contributors to accident statistics.
- Fatal accidents are more prevalent during nighttime hours and on weekends.
